This API is for my own TTRPG character sheet. At least at the moment that is all it is for. There are plans to turn it
into a compendium for my own custom world for playing TTRPGS.

It will initally contain endpoints for obtaining information about the races and classes in the game.

It will also allow one to retrieve saved characters and adjust their stats and items as needed and update them in the
database when it is saved.
